Task: Rebuild trading page to connect to real trade execution APIs

Work Log:
- Rewrote /src/components/tradepro/pages/trading-page.tsx to replace all mock data with real API integration
- Key changes:
  1. **Watchlist**: Fetches stocks from GET /api/trade/stocks on mount with Bearer token auth. Shows loading skeletons while fetching. Clicking a card selects that stock for trading. Search filter works against API-returned stock list.
  2. **Selected Stock State**: When a stock is selected, chart area dynamically shows its symbol, name, currentPrice, change, changePercent. Chart data is generated based on selected stock's price range. Default selection is first stock from API.
  3. **Order Panel**: 
     - Place Order button calls POST /api/trade/place with proper body: symbol, direction (BUY/SELL), orderType (MARKET/LIMIT), segment (EQUITY), productType (INTRADAY/DELIVERY), quantity, and price for LIMIT orders
     - Shows loading spinner (Loader2) while placing order
     - Shows green toast (sonner) with trade details on success
     - Shows red toast with error message on failure
     - After successful order, refreshes positions and portfolio data
     - Added Product Type selector (Intraday/Delivery)
     - Shows selected stock indicator with current price at top of order panel
  4. **Positions Table**: Fetches from GET /api/trade/positions on mount and after each trade. Shows real positions from API with symbol, side (Long/Short based on tradeDirection), segment, qty, avg price, CMP, and P&L. Added "Square Off" button per row that calls POST /api/trade/square-off with positionId. Shows loading state per-row while squaring off. Empty state shown when no positions.
  5. **Account Balance**: Fetches from GET /api/trade/portfolio for available balance and buying power. Falls back to auth store user data if portfolio fetch fails.
  6. **Estimated Total**: Calculated dynamically based on selected stock's currentPrice × quantity (for MARKET) or limit price × quantity (for LIMIT).
  7. **Brokerage Display**: Shows estimated brokerage (0.05%, min ₹20, max ₹500) and total including brokerage in the order panel summary.
